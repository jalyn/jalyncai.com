It’s 9:57 PM and I’m drafting this out on my phone right now (my external monitor fizzled out earlier this week – moment of silence please).</p><p>I’m still not sure how to fit in all the things I want to accomplish within the hours of the day after work has taken up a whole chunk of it (read, write, watch stuff, play the ukulele, walk… the list goes on), and still be able to get to bed at a decent time.</p><p>Still, there’s at least some correlation that good sleep quality will perpetuate the healthy parts of our lives (even though this <a href=https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/ target=_blank rel=noopener>debunking and ongoing drama of Why We Sleep</a> cracked me up), which is why I’ve been trying to make my sleep environment and circumstances better.</p><h2 id=changes-ive-been-making>Changes I’ve been making<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#changes-ive-been-making>¶</a></h2><p>What gets measured gets managed, and in hindsight, I’m actually surprised at myself that I wasn’t already tracking my sleep, given that I track every other aspect of my life.</p><p>For now, I’m using SleepScore and have been for the past three weeks, but there are a couple of issues. One of them is that I have to keep it by my bedside, which definitely keeps me in the habit of scrolling forever before I decide to drift off too.</p><p>The other bigger issue is its inaccuracy on some nights, where there will be long periods of no detection. This skews the tracking and obviously defeats the point. So, to that end, I have bought a FitBit Charge that should be getting to me soon!</p><p>Outside of that, I have also been trying to sleep before midnight. It’s a weird thing, because I feel like I’m losing precious time going to sleep at an earlier hour, even though I know that the effects of sleeping early will compound in ways that trying to keep myself awake would.</p><p>Especially when I’m trying to keep awake trying to read one last thing, or watch one last thing, or continue conversations.</p><p>Exactly like my two-and-a-half-years-old nephews.</p><p>(Check back on this experiment in a bit; I’ll probably write an update to track my progress!)</p></div><div class=backlink><hr><h4>Linked mentions</h4><div class=linked-mentions><a href=/winddown/><div class=mention-item><h5>Trying a new wind-down routine</h5><div class=entry-content>The last time I talked about my sleep was in 2020, where I laid out how terrible my night routine was, amidst other things.
This year, I have been working on being more consistent with sleeping by 10:30pm so that I can be awake by 6:45am, at the latest. I enjoy being up just before the sun is, and I find that I get more done in the early hours.</div></div></a><a href=/2020-year-in-review/><div class=mention-item><h5>2020: Year in Review</h5><div class=entry-content>Oh, 2020. A year that started out promisingly, and subsequently veered off-course about fifty million times over.
I’m one of the lucky ones – holding the privilege to hold my job and not worry about money, not having to experience the tremendous loss and the grief the pandemic brought, and living in a country where the response hasn’t been just a real life depiction of my favorite gif.
So, I’m happy to see 2020 behind us.</div></div></a><a href=/fitbit-charge-4/><div class=mention-item><h5>One+ month with the FitBit Charge 4</h5><div class=entry-content>Two months ago, I talked about my terrible sleep habits, and how using an app on the phone to track my sleep wasn’t the best solution for me at the time.
Since then, I’ve gotten my FitBit Charge 4, and have been using it for a little over a month. I got the Storm Blue Classic Band — to be more accurate, my friend Siew who placed the order for me got me that variant (I told her to surprise me) — but any of the other choices would have fit my dark and neutral wardrobe anyway.</div></div></a></div></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://jalyncai.com/photo-storage/><span class=title><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-arrow-left" style="user-select:text"><line x1="19" y1="12" x2="5" y2="12" style="user-select:text"/><polyline points="12 19 5 12 12 5" style="user-select:text"/></svg>&nbsp;Previous</span><br><span>On Photo Storage & Google's Take-Backsies</span>
