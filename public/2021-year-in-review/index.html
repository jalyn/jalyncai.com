This is going to be my third full year of pursuing FIRE (or at least the FI part of things), and I’m well on track, so that makes me happy. With the repair costs hastily calculated in, I’m down a couple of percents, but all in all it’s still below my budgeted expenses of the year.</li><li><strong>Work</strong>: I had so much to talk about during my impact discussion, which was further bolstered by my colleagues’ really kind feedback and words for my improvement. There was also the matter of getting into the Next Generation Leadership Team (<a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CXi6VawgxuO/ target=_blank rel=noopener>second slide in this post!</a>) when I didn’t think I would.</li><li><strong>Writing:</strong> This is threefold — I wrote a post here every week for a year (minus the weird month last month that I paused), wrote 2 journal entries every day (one for a more regular recap, and another with Day One’s daily prompts), and also wrote a few pieces of fic which I’m proud of, because I’d never done that for my ride-or-die fandom despite being in it for nearly a decade now.</li></ul><h2 id=what-couldve-gone-better>What could’ve gone better:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-couldve-gone-better>¶</a></h2><ul><li>Everything about my <strong>health</strong>, including:<ul><li>My eating habits — timing, quantity, and quality;</li><li>Working out — I won’t blame it on the vaccines, but I turned “no strenuous activity for 2 weeks” into much longer;</li><li>Hitting my daily step count — some time around June I said fuck it to 10k a day, scaled it down to 5k, <em>and</em> then had trouble hitting those</li></ul></li><li><strong>Reading</strong>: <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/24940419 target=_blank rel=noopener>I did it.</a> I did 60 books. I’m not proud of it, because I speed-read the fuck out of those last 15 books and let’s just say I do <em>not</em> want to do it again, so this year? This year I’m going to slow down, and read just “enough”.</li><li><strong>Skills:</strong> Did not learn a new language. Or calligraphy. Picked up a couple of Thai swear words though, does that count?</li><li><strong>Mentality</strong>: I heard it over and over again from my colleagues and friends — stop being so hard on yourself.</li><li><strong>Money:</strong> Even though I’d talked about all the good stuff with money in the previous section, one thing did make me feel slightly embarrassed: in-app purchases for chips in my poker games. It’s illegal in Singapore to gamble online, so I was just frivolously spending real money in exchange for fake money.Luckily (and this is a huge luckily), the support team accidentally unlinked my account and I can’t access that anymore, which made my refund requests to Apple legitimate when I did it after 2 weeks of no response from said support team.</li></ul><h2 id=other-stuff>Other stuff:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#other-stuff>¶</a></h2><ul><li>I met some pretty cool people this year, and I’m thankful to have crossed paths with them and looking forward to forging even tighter friendships going forward!</li><li>2021’s major learning-in-a-structured-manner was the <a href=/learning-harder>d.MBA</a>, and I’m itching to apply that knowledge to actual work.</li><li>2021 was also my second year of meditating every morning</li><li>Got extremely into poker near the end of October — thanks to Maria Konnikova’s <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49814228-the-biggest-bluff target=_blank rel=noopener><em>The Biggest Bluff</em></a> — and while I’ve just been playing it online (with fake stakes), I think I might consider taking a vacation somewhere and playing some super low stakes games in person.</li><li>Getting to be <a href=https://adplist.org/mentors/jalyn-cai target=_blank rel=noopener>a mentor on ADPList</a> had been really fulfilling, though really time-consuming! Alas, I think I’m no longer getting any traffic from the actual directory, and haven’t been getting any new bookings since… I wanna say November?

It seems a little tougher this year — and I won’t say whether it’s because I haven’t been consistently and habitually writing on this site — but I’m always happy to reflect and introspect on what has gone well and what I could’ve done better with.
What went well: Learning and growth: Last year, one of my goals was to try and figure out whether to take my MBA aspiration more seriously.</div></div></a><a href=/2022-year-in-review/><div class=mention-item><h5>2022: Year in Review</h5><div class=entry-content>It’s become a habit now; a yearly one, to look back on the year that has passed and reflect on what has gone well and what could’ve gone better (see: 2021, 2020).

2022 has been a mixed bag of blessings and regrets, and of going on auto-pilot and letting things fall on the wayside.</div></div></a></div></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=http://localhost:1313/iamremarkable/><span class=title><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-arrow-left" style="user-select:text"><line x1="19" y1="12" x2="5" y2="12" style="user-select:text"/><polyline points="12 19 5 12 12 5" style="user-select:text"/></svg>&nbsp;Previous</span><br><span>#IAmRemarkable</span>
