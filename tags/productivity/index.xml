      <description>I used to be that person. You know, the one who would wake up at 8:47 if I had to be out of the house by 9, patting myself on the back for not wasting any time.
The routine was planned down to the second:
Get out of bed (3 minutes to roll around and contemplate why I have to wake up, groan, and check my phone notifications) Go to the bathroom (7 minutes — no time for sun screen!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I used to be <em>that</em> person. You know, the one who would wake up at 8:47 if I had to be out of the house by 9, patting myself on the back for not wasting any time.</p>
<p>The routine was planned down to the second:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get out of bed (3 minutes to roll around and contemplate why I have to wake up, groan, and check my phone notifications)</li>
<li>Go to the bathroom (7 minutes — no time for sun screen!)</li>
<li>Put on my clothes and socks and shoes, and grab my bag (1.5 minutes, hope fervently that I haven’t forgotten any items)</li>
<li>Run down to the bus line (1.5 minutes, and then I pretend I’m not gasping for air once I’m on the bus)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, if I did these things fast enough, I’d even have time to check my Instagram feed before the bus arrives. Score!</p>
<p>All in the name of optimization, right?</p>
<h2 id="why-a-morning-routine">Why a morning routine?</h2>
<p>Here’s the question I struggled with, as I learned more about other people’s morning routines: Why bother with doing other things in an actual routine, when I could be ready in 13 minutes from bed to bus?</p>
<p>The answer, I find out after begrudgingly experimenting, is that not everything is about efficiency.</p>
<p>A chaotic morning sets the tone for an equally chaotic day. Rushing through those 13 minutes left me constantly playing catch-up, both physically and mentally. I wasn’t starting the day on my own terms; I was simply reacting to the world around me.</p>
<p>Even on weekends when I had nowhere to be at 9, the chaos followed me in different ways, like picking up my phone and staying glued to it, (doom-)scrolling until half the day had slipped by.</p>
<p>By noon, I’d have nothing to show for it, but a drained battery — my phone’s, and my own energy — and that familiar foreboding sense of “I should’ve done something”.</p>
<p>For me, the morning routine is about setting the day right, and how I show up for myself every day by completing what I have set out as a <a href="/non-negotiables"  >non-negotiables</a>.</p>
<p>More than that, it’s a guard rail against procrastination, knowing that I have a series of objectives I want to hit and <a href="/streaks"  >continue my streaks on</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-components-of-a-routine">The components of a routine</h2>
<p>It shouldn’t come as a shock that an intentional morning routine plays a crucial role in setting the day right.</p>
<p>Some parts are unavoidable, like the fact that you’d have to go to the bathroom, or getting dressed (and helping the kids too, if you’re a parent!).</p>
<p>But there are experiments that you can tailor and build for your own needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Getting some water in you, whether that means plain, or mixed with minerals and electrolytes</li>
<li><strong>Movement:</strong> Any kind works — walking, stretching, yoga, gym, pilates, running… as long as you’re not jumping back under your blankets</li>
<li><strong>Mindfulness:</strong> Small practices that yield big mental dividends with journaling, gratitude listing, morning pages, meditating, or praying</li>
<li><strong>Light exposure:</strong> Getting the sunlight into your eyes, as popularized by Dr. Andrew Huberman, proven to trigger hormones that increase your energy and mood</li>
<li><strong>Reading:</strong> Try a few pages, or see how much you can read in 10 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Bonus points if you’ve prepped for this so you can just pop it into a microwave oven</li>
<li><strong>Skincare:</strong> A little goes a long way with some moisturizer and sunscreen</li>
<li><strong>Cold shower:</strong> A bracing way to energize and shock yourself into action</li>
<li><strong>Hobby-time:</strong> If you’ve always felt like you have no time to spend on something you find meaningful and fun, build that into your mornings while your mind is still fresh</li>
<li><strong>Caffeine:</strong> Coffee, tea, pre-workout — whatever you need to keep the sluggishness away</li>
<li><strong>Planning:</strong> Look ahead at your day, and get clarity and prioritize what needs to be done</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, the key isn’t to do <em>everything</em>, but to see which ones could positively impact your day.</p>
<p>Falling into the trap of trying to do too much, too soon, is too easy. Evaluate what you can make stick. Like other habits, consistency is going to help make this an automated part of your life.</p>
<h2 id="my-routine-in-experimentation">My routine, in experimentation</h2>
<h3 id="the-waking-moment">The waking moment</h3>
<p>I wake up at 6:30am, walk about ten steps away to my desk, and switch the phone alarm off. In a new note in Obsidian, I quickly jot down my dreams, or what I can remember of them, and in the subject of the note, <a href="/waking"  >I pen down what I’m grateful for in the moment</a>.</p>
<h3 id="skincare">Skincare</h3>
<p>Then, I head into the bathroom. After, I wash my face and slap some sunscreen on.</p>
<h3 id="hydration">Hydration</h3>
<p>I step on my smart body scale to document my weight and body fat percentage. After that, I drink about 500ml of water.</p>
<h3 id="movement">Movement</h3>
<p>It diverges into 2 paths here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gym day: I grind some coffee beans, mix the espresso with protein powder for a pre-workout drink, and spend the next hour and a half at the gym</li>
<li>Walking: This is a new one that I’ve implemented just over a month ago! I put on my walking shoes and walk for 45 minutes, while the morning air and ground are cool. Previously, I’d jump straight to showering and starting on the day’s work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cold-shower--meditation">Cold shower &amp; meditation</h3>
<p>When I come back from either, I take a cold shower, then do a quick 15-minute meditation at my desk.</p>
<h3 id="hobby">Hobby</h3>
<p>Recently, I’ve added a 15-minute Duolingo session. I know it’s not the most efficient way of studying a new language, but it’s fun and it helps my brain to shift into a different mode.</p>
<h3 id="planning">Planning</h3>
<p>Finally, once that is done, I look at my calendar and personal kanban board, to remind me of what’s possible for the day.</p>
<h2 id="the-evolution-of-the-morning-routine">The evolution of the morning routine</h2>
<p>Shaping the routine is going to be an ongoing process.</p>
<p>There will be periods when your life demands a more streamlined approach, and you’ll have to stick with the essentials.</p>
<p>Other times, you might find yourself with more space and time to add on components to your build.</p>
<p>The key, as with other things in your life, is being flexible and experimenting with what works for <em>you</em> and your intentions.</p>
<h2 id="your-turn-starting-small">Your turn: Starting small</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify your drivers:</strong> Figure out what you want to get out of a structured routine. Is it more energy, a sense of accomplishment, or a calmer start?</li>
<li><strong>Start with one thing, and be consistent:</strong> It’s better to do one thing well than five things haphazardly.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment and adjust:</strong> Evaluate after a week. Keep a log (mental, or otherwise) of how you feel about each component. If it’s working, great! Let’s add another. If it doesn’t, replace it based on your drivers in step one.</li>
<li><strong>Be kind to yourself:</strong> You’ll have setbacks when you feel like doing anything but the routine. Progress, not perfection, is the goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s one change you’d like to make to your morning routine? I’d love to discuss what’s working and what isn’t, and your victories and challenges!</p>

      <title>Non-negotiable habits</title>

      <description>There are things in life that people do automatically, like motor reflexes with blinking and swallowing, or actions like locking the door and — unfortunately — checking the phone for notifications.
Similar to values that you do not compromise on, your actions stack towards habits that form the cornerstones of your life. These actions set the tone for how you feel and provides the momentum for other positive habits you’re trying to build.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are things in life that people <em>do</em> automatically, like motor reflexes with blinking and swallowing, or actions like locking the door and — unfortunately — checking the phone for notifications.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.rd.com/article/non-negotiables/"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" >values that you do not compromise on</a>, your actions stack towards habits that form the cornerstones of your life. These actions set the tone for how you feel and provides the momentum for other positive habits you’re trying to build.</p>
<hr>
<p>With a few years of experiments on my belt, here are my non-negotiable habits as of August 2024.</p>
<h3 id="one-liner-gratitude-when-i-wake-up">One-liner gratitude when I wake up</h3>
<p>When the alarm on the phone goes off, I make the ten-step hike from my bed to the table and switch it off.</p>
<p>I start a new entry in my daily log on Notion; take a pause through the haziness of sleep, and write one thing that I am grateful for, in the title of the entry.</p>
<p>Logging it on Notion serves as a time stamp for my wake-up times, which is always useful for trend-spotting each month.</p>
<p>I try to log down my dream(s) in the body of the note. <a href="/waking"  >They disappear like wisps, sometimes.</a></p>
<h3 id="tracking-my-time-nutrition-and-expenses">Tracking: My time, nutrition, and expenses</h3>
<p>Even though we now know that the quote <a href="https://nesslabs.com/what-gets-measured-gets-managed"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" >“what gets measured gets managed”</a> is a misnomer at best, and an opposite interpretation at worst, it is still helpful for me.</p>
<p>First, it gives me the outputs for my behaviour.</p>
<p>Want to know how many minutes I’ve invested in traveling this year? I see it in <a href="https://toggl.com/"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Toggl</a>, and because I’ve been tracking since 2018, I can work out how many experience dividends I’m getting from year to year.</p>
<p>Want to know how much money I’m spending on groceries up until today for the month? <a href="https://www.spendee.com/"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Spendee</a> tells me the amount, because I’ve made it a habit to log every purchase the moment I make them.</p>
<p>And for nutrition? It’s the same logic, and helpful as I keep track of the amount of protein I ingest every day.</p>
<p>Secondly, and more importantly, the act of doing the thing makes me want to be more conscientious and deliberate. This has been a huge mind shift in the way I approach these building blocks of life.</p>
<p>(Though there is something to be said about the scarcity mindset I have observed in me sometimes. Something to experiment more on!)</p>
<h3 id="work-outs-at-least-three-times-a-week">Work outs, at least three times a week</h3>
<p>My workout routine has me completing four workouts a week, so three times is keeping it safe on weeks where I feel like <a href="/spondy"  >my back can’t handle more than</a>, or if I fall sick/injured.</p>
<p>On typical weeks when I’m not traveling, I pick myself up first thing in the morning to do them. It sets my energy levels higher through the day when I do, but there are slight differences in power and endurance when I do them later on in the day.</p>
<p>As an addition, at a minimum I’m aiming for <em>activity</em> every day. It’s a morning walk these days, on days I don’t go to the gym.</p>
<h3 id="meditating-at-least-10-minutes-a-day">Meditating, at least 10 minutes a day</h3>
<p>I don’t have a set time for when I do this; even with a 1,695 day streak, I’m still playing around with what works best.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that I <em>do</em> it, whether it is right before I settle into working, during a break in the middle of the day, or when I am walking.</p>
<h3 id="reading-at-least-ten-minutes-a-day">Reading, at least ten minutes a day</h3>
<p>My Kindle (a pretty laggy 7th-gen Paperwhite) is never far from me — on my desk, on the table, in my bag — and if I have free moments in between calls at work, I’m trying to reach the end of a chapter in a non-fiction book.</p>
<p>Additionally, I block half an hour before bedtime to do light fiction reading, though the time expands and contracts depending on when the work day ends; something to work on more diligently.</p>
<h3 id="journaling-before-i-sleep">Journaling before I sleep</h3>
<p>Through my life I have trialed and tested many different mediums (digital vs. a proper journal), timings (mornings vs. nights), and methods (free writing, lists, bullet, unsent letters…).</p>
<p>For now, I journal on <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Day One</a> through my phone (it’s telling me I have a 1,413 day streak today!), where I have two journals: one for free-form writing about what happened during the day, and another to answer the daily prompt.</p>
<p>The free-form writing journal gives me the chance to unload what is on my mind that has been playing incessantly throughout the day.</p>
<p>I find that reflecting on my actions, and dumping the contents of my brain to work through potential solutions, ways I should be reacting, and paths forward has been helpful in clarity.</p>
<p>For the daily prompts, that’s just a fun way to surface topics I wouldn’t think of, and reach to the edges of diving into them.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m probably forgetting non-negotiables that are second nature to me (i.e. drinking 2 litres of water, using dental floss, applying sunblock), but that is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>More that I am thinking about: Is there an optimal number or a maximum of habits before the system falls apart? What about rigidity vs. fluidity of the way I act upon them? Psychological barriers or breakthroughs?</p>

      <title>Why and how I track every minute of my life</title>

      <description>It’s 2015, and my workplace was exploring different tools for resource management.
It started when the team lead wanted a way to “sell” our services as an in-house team (and I’ll be honest, I’m not sure that quantifying time spent was the way to do it but that’s a story for another day), so we went through a few, finding the pros and cons of each before settling on Harvest.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s 2015, and my workplace was exploring different tools for resource management.</p>
<p>It started when the team lead wanted a way to “sell” our services as an in-house team (and I’ll be honest, I’m not sure that quantifying time spent was the way to do it but that’s a story for another day), so we went through a few, finding the pros and cons of each before settling on Harvest.</p>
<p>I think it’s because it was the cheapest per seat, maybe?</p>
<p>But that whole exercise of finding a tool and figuring out what worked and what didn’t also led me to think about my <em>own</em> hours, outside of work.</p>
<p>I hadn’t come across <a href="https://lauravanderkam.com/2017/09/welcome-168-hours-time-tracking-challenge/"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Laura Vanderkam</a>‘s content at that point, so it was trial and error on my part to figuring out what I was tracking.</p>
<p>I remember polling my friends and colleagues about my information architecture — or really just categories or buckets of time, occupational hazard aside — and trying to see if I was being too pedantic about some things, and too general for others.</p>
<p>So… I guess the question begs: Why do I track my time?</p>
<p>It started out as a way for me to find out where I was spending (wasting) my time — back in 2015, the time I took to commute was definitely an issue on my mind, and I feel like being able to clock that time made me aware of 1) how much it was, and 2) where it ranked amongst my other ‘smaller’ activities, like going to the gym.</p>
<p>More than that, I figured that if I knew what I was doing, and for how long, I could in theory optimize my time and productivity. I also remember thinking a lot about what that tipping point would be, for me to use money to buy time, instead of spending my time to get money instead.</p>
<h3 id="things-i-should-know-with-common-sense-but-instead-knew-for-sure">Things I should know with common sense, but instead knew for sure:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I spend way too much time beyond my 40 hours a week for work</li>
<li>(That isn’t counting the work-adjacent activity, which includes things like training, development courses/classes that are specifically applied at work, and as of 2021, mentoring sessions)</li>
<li>Meal prep is a really effective time saver, even though the upfront cost of it seems high (I spend about 45 minutes every Sunday doing it, compared to ~25 minutes a day)</li>
<li>Being lazy in bed is an actual bad habit of mine</li>
<li>Sometimes I chunk a lot of activity under “Internet”, even though I have specific buckets for media consumption, reading, fandom stuff etc. Pretty sure that’s indicative of a bigger problem, which is that I (falsely) think I can multitask</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>That said, Toggl — the app I’ve been using since 2015 — <a href="https://twitter.com/toggltrack/status/1431554352506884096"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" >had a functional error</a> over the weekend, and it’s thrown me off the loop as I keep trying to open the app on my phone. Hopefully that gets resolved soon.</p>
<p>Let me know if you try out tracking your time, even if just for a week, and if you see any surprises in there!</p>

      <title>A snapshot of my waking moments</title>

      <description>When I wake up, I reach for my phone.
Not checking for messages or notifications (though sometimes I sneak a glimpse), but to start a new entry in my daily log on Notion.
The first thing I do is start typing all that I remember from — hopefully — a night of dreaming. I dream quite vividly, and it’s a race against time to record that down, translating something that had made so much sense in dream land to something that is coherent in actual words.</description>

<p>The first thing I do is start typing all that I remember from — hopefully — a night of dreaming. I dream quite vividly, and it’s a race against time to record that down, translating something that had made so much sense in dream land to something that is coherent in actual words.</p>
<p>(Yesterday I dreamt I’d forgotten my mask and had to use the hood from my hoodie to cover my face while walking.</p>
<p>The day before: I had to hide in the toilets from a man who was hunting me but it wasn’t not working, and he was also the father of the witches who’s at fault for all the deaths (???).</p>
<p>Yeah. Exciting!)</p>
<p>When I’m done with scrambling to write everything I can remember before they all dissolve into wisps of nothingness in my memory, I fill up the title of the entry with one thing I’m grateful for in my life.</p>
<p>These days, I find that I’m thankful for these general patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting through a work day or week</li>
<li>Having free time/anticipating free time</li>
<li>Spending quality time with people</li>
</ul>
<p>Thematically, they all have to do with time and how I spend it, which tracks.</p>
<p>(And then I proceed to spend another twenty minutes in bed just lazing.)</p>
