I’m really hoping that it isn’t a harbinger of things to come in 2025.</p><p>Onward!</p><h2 id=what-went-well>What went well<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-went-well>¶</a></h2><p><strong>Strength:</strong> If you know me, you know I’ve struggled with fitness my entire life: issues with my lower back, my lungs, a self-imposed limiting belief that I’m “just not athletic”.</p><p>But with great aplomb (and a drum roll, please): I lost ~13% of myself in 2024! My InBody scale tells me nearly all of it was fat loss, and I’m not about to argue with it.</p><p>This was a combination of nutrition, the 160 workouts I did — approximately one workout every 2.28 days — and physical therapy exercises for my back, which left me feeling lighter and stronger than ever.</p><p>A major breakthrough was finally cracking the cardio code: daily treadmill walks for 45 minutes — while reading on my Kindle (important! I look forward to these treadmill sessions because of this).</p><p>On the food intake end, my concept of <em>minimal viable protein</em> served me well for days that are both typical, and not (traveling, for example).</p><p>Lastly, I addressed loose ends (i.e. fixing my infected implant, getting a cyst on my scalp removed, being better at skincare and sunscreen application, etc etc.)</p><p>—</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> This has been a transformative year internally. A recurring theme in past yearly reviews had been about work, and how much that had vexed me. Those alone should’ve raised alarm bells, but I ignored them, year after year.</p><p>In the second half of the year, something clicked: it wasn’t finding another job in the corporate world, nor was it climbing the ladder and losing even more of myself in the process.</p><p>Instead, I started examining what my skills (design, operations, strategy) could create impact, beyond the confines of corporate structures.</p><p>That’s when the idea of turning the design process inward came, using it to fuel personal development and growth. From this emerged the concept of being a <em>full stack being</em>, centered on building strength, thinking, alignment, connection and knowledge.</p><p>This shift transformed my focus from merely staying afloat as a design leader in a consultancy, to writing and using design as a vehicle for exploration and experimentation. It’s a move beyond delivering user flows, screens, and slide after slide of a “UX strategy” destined to be dismissed.</p><p>(Can you feel my burnout and jadedness of the craft?)</p><p>So far, I’ve launched a newsletter, and an Instagram exploring this concept.</p><p>But more on these in the months ahead :)</p><p><strong>New skills:</strong> Like my GMAT exam on the day before a year-end trip last year, 2024 repeated that pattern with my driving license (though it was planned to be earlier in November, but I had failed the first attempt). I’m now able to legally terrorize the streets!</p><p>I also took on side quests that I hadn’t planned on, with skiing, learning Spanish, and playing chess as my top three highlights of skills acquired. They weren’t part of a grand plan, but they brought me joy and are stark reminders that staying curious and open are my core values.</p><p><strong>More traveling:</strong> I zipped around a fair bit: Germany, Austria, The Philippines, The UK, France, Malaysia, then finally to China. It’s a cliche, but I truly do love it.</p><h2 id=what-couldve-gone-better>What could’ve gone better<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-couldve-gone-better>¶</a></h2><p><strong>Improving focus and reducing screen time:</strong> This isn’t an uncommon issue amongst the chronically online. I found myself reaching for my phone, doom scrolling through social media and Reddit, even though I <em>know</em> I should be doing anything else instead.</p><p>Case in point: I just wasted 15 minutes scrolling through YouTube shorts. YouTube shorts! How did I even get there?!</p><p>Screen time was abysmal; huge chunks of hours without me even realizing it. I’ve put in a few guardrails, like using greyscale mode and setting time limits, but it’s clear I ned more deliberate approaches.</p><p>The lack of focus connects to a larger problem: avoiding discomfort and boredom. Recognizing it is half the battle (I hope!) and now it’ll be about sitting with these feelings and finding alternatives.</p><p>—</p><p><strong>Speed in decision making:</strong> A pattern of overthinking and analysis paralysis underpins this, and ends up with me wasting time by not moving forward and getting stuck in loops.</p><p>Or maybe it’s the perfectionist streak in me, with unrealistic expectations of how fast things should move. We’ll unpack this a lot more in 2025, I hope!</p><p>—</p><p><strong>Managing anxiety more effectively:</strong> I am, by default, wrought with anxiety. It’s basically background noise to me now. I’ve been trying all the usual tricks — meditating, journaling, working out — but there is a baseline that I return to.</p><p>Then there were the things I was excessively anxious about: the layoffs in the company, how my teammates were coping, my financial situation in the case that it drops on me.</p><p>But I learned an important lesson here: no amount of anxiety makes any difference to anything that is going to happen. Instead, I want to try and shift my focus on the things that are going to move the needle, and converting that into something constructive instead.</p><h2 id=themes-from-my-gratitude-journal>Themes from my gratitude journal<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#themes-from-my-gratitude-journal>¶</a></h2><ul><li>Having the time and space to think and experiment</li><li>Traveling and exploring new places</li><li>The nephews being happy; spending time with them</li><li>Doing new things that scare me</li><li>Being excited about life again</li><li>Doing things that brought joy</li></ul><h2 id=what-i-want-to-do-in-2025>What I want to do in 2025<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-i-want-to-do-in-2025>¶</a></h2><h3 id=strength>Strength<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#strength>¶</a></h3><ul><li>Feel lighter and more energetic</li><li>Get technically better at skiing</li></ul><h3 id=thinking>Thinking:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#thinking>¶</a></h3><ul><li>Let go of the scarcity mindset and internalize that “investing in yourself is not a waste</li><li>Reduce phone usage as default for boredom</li></ul><h3 id=alignment>Alignment<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#alignment>¶</a></h3><ul><li>Build the full stack life in public</li><li>Redefine what good enough work and great work look like outside the corporate world</li></ul><h3 id=connection>Connection<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#connection>¶</a></h3><ul><li>More solo traveling</li></ul><h3 id=knowledge>Knowledge<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#knowledge>¶</a></h3><ul><li>Consistently learn how to play the guitar</li><li>Leave space for side quests</li></ul><p>I’m hopeful that the theme of 2025 is one of exploration, and giving myself permission to wander off the main path of conventions and expectations.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav><a class=next href=https://jalyncai.com/change/><span class=title>Next&nbsp;<svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-arrow-right" style="user-select:text"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12" style="user-select:text"/><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19" style="user-select:text"/></svg></span><br><span>Challenges create change</span></a></nav></footer><div class=comments-separator></div></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=https://jalyncai.com/>Jalyn Cai</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M233.4 105.4c12.5-12.5 32.8-12.5 45.3.0l192 192c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8.0 45.3s-32.8 12.5-45.3.0L256 173.3 86.6 342.6c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3.0s-12.5-32.8.0-45.3l192-192z"/></svg>
